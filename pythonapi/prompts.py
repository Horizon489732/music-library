Reformat the following user-provided music description into a simple comma-separated list of audio tags.

User Description: "{user_prompt}"

Follow these guidelines strictly when reformatting. Include a tag from each category below in your final list:
- Include genre (e.g., "rap", "pop", "rock", "electronic")
- Include vocal type (e.g., "male vocal", "female vocal", "spoken word")
- Include instruments actually heard (e.g., "guitar", "piano", "synthesizer", "drums")
- Include mood/energy (e.g., "energetic", "calm", "aggressive", "melancholic")
- Include tempo if known (e.g., "120 bpm", "fast tempo", "slow tempo")
- Include key if known (e.g., "major key", "minor key", "C major")
- The output must be a single line of comma-separated tags. Do not add any other text or explanation. For example: melodic techno, male vocal, electronic, emotional, minor key, 124 bpm, synthesizer, driving, atmospheric

LYRICS_GENERATOR_PROMPT = """
Write original song lyrics based on the following description.

Description: "{description}"

Guidelines:
1. Structure the song using clear section tags: [intro], [verse], [chorus], [bridge], [outro].
2. Maintain a consistent theme, tone, and emotional arc that fits the description.
3. Ensure the lyrics are singable, rhythmic, and coherent — avoid unnecessary narration or exposition.
4. Keep the length balanced.
5. Use creative language and imagery appropriate for the style.

Example format:
"[verse]\nWoke up in a city that's always alive\nNeon lights they shimmer they thrive\nElectric pulses beat they drive\nMy heart races just to survive\n\n[chorus]\nOh electric dreams they keep me high\nThrough the wires I soar and fly\nMidnight rhythms in the sky\nElectric dreams together we’ll defy\n\n[verse]\nLost in the labyrinth of screens\nVirtual love or so it seems\nIn the night the city gleams\nDigital faces haunted by memes\n\n[chorus]\nOh electric dreams they keep me high\nThrough the wires I soar and fly\nMidnight rhythms in the sky\nElectric dreams together we’ll defy\n\n[bridge]\nSilent whispers in my ear\nPixelated love serene and clear\nThrough the chaos find you near\nIn electric dreams no fear\n\n[verse]\nBound by circuits intertwined\nLove like ours is hard to find\nIn this world we’re truly blind\nBut electric dreams free the mind"
